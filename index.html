  The United States Geological Survey (USGS) collects and provides scientific data on natural hazards 
  and the health of our ecosystems and environment. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to 
  supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. This project 
  creates a map utilizing Leaflet showing earthquakes and the magnituge based on USGS data (geoJson).

    The first plot shows the all earthquakes for the day pulled from the USGS
    <a target="_blank" href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php">feed</a>.
    The plot reflects the magnitude of the earthquake based on both the size and the color of each circle. 
    Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color.

    The second plot includes additional information and additional map options. For each earthquake, 
    a popup is available providing location, magnitude and date. The fault line boundaries can are 
    added as well.
