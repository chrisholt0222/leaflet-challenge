# Visualizing Data with Leaflet - Earthquakes

![1-Logo](Images/1-Logo.png)

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) collects and provides scientific data on natural hazards and the health of our ecosystems and environment. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. This project creates a map utilizing Leaflet showing earthquakes and the magnituge based on USGS data (geoJson).

There are two verions: Leaflet-Step-1 and Leaflet-Step-2. Both plot cirles on the world map reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in both size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color. A popup is avialble showing additional information on each earthquake. Leaflet-Step-2 expands on Leaflet-Step-1 including such as the fault line boundaries on the map.
