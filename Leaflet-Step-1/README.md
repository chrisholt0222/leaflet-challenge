# Visualizing Data with Leaflet - Earthquakes - Leaflet-Step-1

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) collects and provides scientific data on natural hazards and the health of our ecosystems and environment. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. This project creates a map utilizing Leaflet showing earthquakes and the magnituge based on USGS data (geoJson).

Leaflet-Step-1 pulls in daily earthquakes from the [USGS site] (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.phpThere). The daily earthquakes are shown as cirles on the world map (centered in US) with the size and color reflecting the magnitude of each earthquake. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color. A popup is avialble showing additional information on each earthquake.
